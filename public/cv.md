**UX/Product Designer & Builder** with 5+ years experience delivering SaaS and government-backed platforms.

My non-traditional career path gives me a unique perspective on design and software. I’ve worked across industries, understanding tools and the people and workflows behind them in every form: software, hardware, and physical systems.

My portfolio includes government-backed projects like **Talk English** (led by Manchester City Council and supported by the Department for Communities and Local Government) and **Northcoders Learn to Code**, a platform I designed as both the first touchpoint for new students and a core system for delivering the bootcamp curriculum.
